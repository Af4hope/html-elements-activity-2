		What is Drawing?
	</h2>
	<p>
		<b>Drawing</b> is a visual art that uses an instrument to mark paper or another two-dimensional surface. The instruments used to make a drawing are pencils, crayons, pens with inks, brushes with paints, or combinations of these, and in more modern times, computer styluses with graphics tablets or gamepads in VR drawing software.

	Drawing Instruments
	</h2>
	<p>
A drawing instrument releases a small amount of material onto a surface, leaving a visible mark. The most common support for drawing is paper, although other materials, such as cardboard, vellum, wood, plastic, leather, canvas, and board, have been used. <br><br>Temporary drawings may be made on a <strong><mark>blackboard or whiteboard</strong></mark>. Drawing has been a popular and fundamental means of public expression throughout human history. It is one of the simplest and most efficient means of communicating ideas.[1] The wide availability of drawing <del>instruments</del>makes drawing one of the most common artistic activities.

		As artistic expression
	</h2>
	<p>
	Drawing is one of the easiest ways to visualise ideas and to express one's creativity; therefore it has been prominent in the world of art. Throughout much of history, drawing was regarded as the foundation for <b><i>artistic practice</b></i>.<sup><small>[10]</sup></small> Initially, <em>artists</em> used and reused wooden tablets for the production of their drawings.<sup><small>[11]</sup></small> Following the widespread availability of paper in the 14th century, the use of drawing in the arts increased. At this point, drawing was commonly used as a tool for thought and investigation, acting as a study medium whilst artists were preparing for their final pieces of work.<sup><small>[12][13]</sup></small> The Renaissance brought about a great sophistication in drawing techniques, enabling artists to represent things more realistically than before,<sup><small>[14]</sup></small> and revealing an interest in geometry and philosophy.<sup><small>[15]</sup></small>

The invention of the first widely available form of photography led to a shift in the hierarchy of the arts.<sup><small>[16]</sup></small>Photography offered an<small> alternative</small> to drawing as a method for accurately representing visual phenomena, and traditional drawing practice was given less emphasis as an essential skill for artists, particularly so in Western society.<sup><small>[9]</sup></small>
